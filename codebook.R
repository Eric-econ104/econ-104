I'll analyze the dataset and provide an overview of its contents, including the variables and their types. Let me check the file now.

Dataset Overview
This dataset contains statistics on the number of Taiwanese citizens traveling abroad by destination from 2002 to 2024.

Variables:
首站抵達地 (First Destination) - The region where travelers first arrived (e.g., Asia, Europe).
細分 (Subdivision) - Specific countries or territories (e.g., Japan, Korea, Hong Kong).
2002 - 2024 - Annual travel numbers from 2002 to 2024.
Variable Types:
首站抵達地 (First Destination) - Categorical (String)
細分 (Subdivision) - Categorical (String)
2002 - 2024 (Annual travel numbers) - Currently stored as Strings (likely due to commas in numbers). Should be converted to Numeric (Integer) for analysis.
Would you like me to clean and preprocess the data for better analysis?
